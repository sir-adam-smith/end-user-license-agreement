### Dispute Resolution

Any disputes, claims, questions, or disagreements arising out of or relating to this End User License Agreement (EULA) or the breach thereof, shall initially be resolved through good faith negotiations between the parties.

The arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the Arbitration Foundation of Southern Africa (AFSA) and shall take place in [Your City, South Africa]. The arbitration shall be conducted in the English language. The decision of the arbitrator shall be final and binding on both parties, and the arbitrator's award may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties agree that any matters not subject to arbitration, as well as any legal actions to enforce the arbitration award, shall be brought in the courts of Johannesburg, South Africa. The parties hereby consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of such courts for these purposes.
